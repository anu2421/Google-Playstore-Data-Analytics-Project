# **Google Play Store Analytics – Internship Project** #
 ## **Project Overview** ##

This project extends my training work on Google Play Store analytics by implementing six advanced analytical dashboards, as part of the internship assignment.

The analysis uses only the provided datasets, applying business-driven filters, time-based visibility rules, and interactive visualizations.

## **Dataset Used** ##

Play Store Data.csv

User Reviews.csv

No external datasets were used.

## **Tools & Technologies** ##

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Plotly (interactive dashboards)

Collab Notebook

Google Looker

GitHub

## 📈 **Implemented Dashboards** ##
**Task 1 – Category Performance**

Grouped bar chart comparing average rating vs total reviews

Filters: rating ≥ 4, size ≥ 10 MB, January updates

Time visibility: 3–5 PM IST

**Task 2 – Global Installs by Category**

World-level choropleth (proxy approach)

Top 5 categories, installs ≥ 1M highlighted

Time visibility: 6–8 PM IST

Assumption: World treated as a single geographic unit due to missing location data

**Task 3 – Free vs Paid Apps**

Dual-axis chart: average installs vs revenue

Filters on installs, revenue, size, Android version, content rating

Time visibility: 1–2 PM IST

**Task 4 – Install Trends Over Time**

Time series chart by category

MoM growth >20% highlighted

Category translations applied

Time visibility: 6–9 PM IST

**Task 5 – Size vs Rating Analysis**

Bubble chart (size vs rating, bubble = installs)

Sentiment subjectivity filter applied

Game category highlighted

Time visibility: 5–7 PM IST

**Task 6 – Cumulative Installs**

Stacked area chart of cumulative installs

Strict filters on rating, size, reviews, category prefix

MoM growth >25% highlighted

Time visibility: 4–6 PM IST

## **Key KPIs Measured** ##

Total installs

Average rating

Review count

Revenue (estimated)
